# Project On Sector Rotation Strategy Optimization
It is an open secret that traders are working hard to reveal valuable insights in the market to maximize returns. 
Finding such insights is challenging, as it requires expert knowledge in the finical field to interpret opaque values 
in the stock market. How can we as non-finical professionals take a share of the spoils? 

In this free time project, I would like to apply Artificial Intelligence (or statistics in case you think is overhyped :)) 
to extract anomalies or regularities from real-world data. AI and Finance, are they a match made in heaven? I am 
looking forward to giving my own answer :)
